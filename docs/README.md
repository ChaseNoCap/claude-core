# Claude-Core Documentation

Welcome to the claude-core documentation! This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about enhancing claude-core with modern Claude CLI features.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### 📖 Reference
- **[Claude CLI Comprehensive Guide](./reference/claude-cli-comprehensive-guide.md)** - Complete reference for all Claude CLI features, flags, and capabilities

### 🚀 Implementation
- **[Prioritized Stories](./implementation/prioritized-stories.md)** - Detailed implementation roadmap with 15 tracked stories across 7 epics
- **[Migration Guide](./implementation/migration-guide.md)** - Safe, incremental migration strategy with validation gates and rollback procedures

### 💻 Examples
- **[Code Patterns](./examples/code-patterns.md)** - Practical code examples and patterns for common use cases

## 🎯 Quick Start

If you're looking to:

1. **Understand Claude CLI capabilities** → Start with the [CLI Comprehensive Guide](./reference/claude-cli-comprehensive-guide.md)
2. **Implement new features** → Follow the [Prioritized Stories](./implementation/prioritized-stories.md)
3. **Migrate existing code** → Use the [Migration Guide](./implementation/migration-guide.md)
4. **See code examples** → Check out [Code Patterns](./examples/code-patterns.md)

## 📋 Implementation Overview

The enhancement project is organized into 7 epics with 15 stories:

### Epic Summary
1. **Core Infrastructure** (P0) - Stream-JSON, JSON output, Authentication
2. **Advanced Tool Management** (P1) - Enhanced restrictions, dangerous mode
3. **Performance & Resilience** (P1) - Rate limiting, timeouts, retry logic
4. **Context Management** (P2) - Window management, system prompts
5. **Advanced Features** (P2) - MCP integration, thinking modes
6. **Developer Experience** (P3) - Auto-completion, analytics
7. **Migration & Cleanup** (P1) - Safe migration path, code cleanup

### Timeline
- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation (streaming, output formats)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Authentication & Security
- **Weeks 5-6**: Performance enhancements
- **Weeks 7-8**: Advanced features
- **Weeks 9-10**: Integration & Polish
- **Weeks 11-12**: Migration & Cleanup

## 🔍 Key Features Being Added

### High Priority
- ✨ Real-time streaming with `--output-format stream-json`
- 🔐 Multi-provider authentication (API key, OAuth, Bedrock, Vertex)
- 📊 Structured JSON output with metadata and cost tracking
- 🛡️ Fine-grained tool permissions and security controls
- ⚡ Intelligent rate limiting with automatic backoff

### Medium Priority
- 🧠 Context window management with intelligent compaction
- 🔧 Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- 💭 Thinking modes support (basic → ultrathink)
- 🔄 Advanced retry logic with circuit breakers

### Future Enhancements
- 🎯 CLI auto-completion for all shells
- 📈 Comprehensive usage analytics and reporting
- 🐳 Docker and CI/CD integration patterns

## 📐 Architecture Principles

1. **No Breaking Changes** - All enhancements maintain backward compatibility
2. **Incremental Adoption** - Features can be enabled gradually via feature flags
3. **Validation First** - Every change goes through multiple validation gates
4. **Performance Focus** - Target >20% performance improvement
5. **Production Ready** - Enterprise-grade error handling and monitoring

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Maintain >90% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Validate against real Claude CLI
- **Performance Tests**: Continuous benchmarking
- **Load Tests**: Validate under production-like conditions
- **A/B Tests**: Compare new vs. old implementations

## 🚦 Validation Gates

1. **Gate 1** (Week 4): Core functionality and security
2. **Gate 2** (Week 8): Performance and reliability
3. **Gate 3** (Week 10): Migration readiness
4. **Gate 4** (Week 12): Final release criteria

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero breaking changes for existing users
- ✅ >90% test coverage maintained
- ✅ >20% performance improvement
- ✅ Support for all modern CLI features
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
